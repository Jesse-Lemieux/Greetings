# :wave: My name is Jesse Lemieux. 

  I am an aspiring web developer based in Connecticut, and I've been working with computers for a very long time. Always discovering and applying my real world experience to my work to constantly adapt and become a more skilled learner every day.

## :star: A little about me 

  I've been facinated by computers since I was pretty young. Back in the days of the early "Guitar Hero" games I actually create my own songs to be played in the game and alter game code to include them! Then MySpace came out shortly after and basically gave me a crash course in HTML. The rest is really history after that, I was full blown nerd status obsessed with computers (even build all of my personal PCs and friends PCs since then!).
  
  I'm a musician and have played in many bands and played many differents styles of music! I'm a guitar player but have have known to dabble with other instruments (terribly). Here is a **[link to my current band's music!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13wMJAvUZb0)**
  
  A couple of side hobbies of mine are golfing and gaming!
